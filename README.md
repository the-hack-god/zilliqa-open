# Generative Fractal Tree :

I have made this project for CENNZnet generative art bounty. It is an object oriented approach towards building a Factral Tree from branch objects and it can be modified at each and every step.You can also create a tree of your own choice and then save it as image, this gives the user a power to choose an art of their choice, as the tree is made by them. You can play around with the tree as much to your liking and explore the generativity with just few clicks.

See the Fractal Generator in action [**HERE.**](https://the-hack-god.github.io/Fractal-Tree-Object-Oriented-/)

# Instructions: 

* Click on the canvas to proceed to the next generation of the fractal.

* You can change the branch angle at each generation using the angle box and you can also alter the relative size slider to choose the size of the branch relative to its parent.

* You can grow and shed leaves, the way the leaves behave when shedded depends on Gravity and Wind which you can alter using the checkboxes in the side panels.

* You can also change the colour and size of leaves using the options on the side panel.

* If you end up with a pattern you like, you can save it as an image using the save button.
