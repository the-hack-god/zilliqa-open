See the Fractal Generator in action [**HERE.**](https://the-hack-god.github.io/zilliqa-open/)

# Instructions: 

* Click on the canvas to proceed to the next generation of the fractal.

* You can change the branch angle at each generation using the angle box and you can also alter the relative size slider to choose the size of the branch relative to its parent.

* You can grow and shed leaves, the way the leaves behave when shedded depends on Gravity and Wind which you can alter using the checkboxes in the side panels.
